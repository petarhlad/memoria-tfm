\chapter{Single use: Anonymity}
\label{chap:single}
We can easily achieve anonimity using "pseudonyms", but usually there is a dealer which is the trusted party. So, the security relies on a single party.

The idea:

Let there be a votation with $l$ choices $Z ={z_1, \dots, z_l}$. The candidate $z_i$ needs at least $t$ votes to be validated.

The system chooses a random polynomial $q_i(x) = a_{0,i} + a_{1,i} x + \cdots + a_{k-1 , i}  x ^{k-1}$ of degree $k-1$ for each candidate, where $a_{0,i} = SK_i$ is the secret that validates each candidate.

abstract="We define strongly ideal secret sharing schemes to be ideal secret sharing schemes in which certain natural requirements are placed on the decoder. We prove an information-theoretic characterization of perfect schemes, and use it to determine which access structures can be encoded by strongly ideal schemes. We also discuss a hierarchy of secret sharing schemes that are more powerful than strongly ideal schemes.",

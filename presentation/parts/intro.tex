\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Goals of the work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Find efficient anonymous threshold signature scheme with compact signature
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Case 1] Toll pricing system that gives discount if there are at least three passengers in vehicle.
\item[Case 2] E-voting system where each candidate needs certain amount of signatures to get to next round.
\item[Case 3] Advertising company pays website holders for showing ads, but only pay on the amount of distinct users receiving the ads.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Requirements for these schemes:
\begin{itemize}
\item All anonymous
\item For case 1: compact signatures, not excessively complex to compute. Could be interactive.
\item For case 2: Non interactive.
\item For case 3: Compact and non interactive.
\end{itemize}

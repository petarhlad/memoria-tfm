\section{Anonymity}
\begin{frame}{Anonymity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many authors use \textit{anonymity} to refer to the case when the public key of the signer is not disclosed.
\item This is not enough for our purposes.
\end{itemize}
In this work, we are looking for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Untraceability: cannot get the public key of the signer from a signature.
\item Unlinkability: cannot decide whether two different signatures were signed by the same signer.
\end{itemize}

Linkable threshold signature schemes are suitable for "one time anonymity".
